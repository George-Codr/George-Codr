For C++, the process is very similar to C, but you need to use `g++` instead of `gcc` to ensure proper handling of C++ features like name mangling. Below are the steps to create a shared object (`.so`) file from multiple C++ source files.

---

### Step 1: Write your C++ source files
Assume you have two C++ source files: `file1.cpp` and `file2.cpp`.

**file1.cpp:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void function1() {
    std::cout << "Function 1 from file1.cpp" << std::endl;
}
```

**file2.cpp:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

void function2() {
    std::cout << "Function 2 from file2.cpp" << std::endl;
}
```

---

### Step 2: Compile the source files into object files
Use the `-fPIC` flag to generate position-independent code, which is required for shared libraries.

```bash
g++ -c -fPIC file1.cpp -o file1.o
g++ -c -fPIC file2.cpp -o file2.o
```

---

### Step 3: Link the object files into a shared library
Use the `-shared` flag to create a shared library.

```bash
g++ -shared file1.o file2.o -o libmylib.so
```

---

### Step 4: Use the shared library
To use the shared library, you need to link it with your main program.

**main.cpp:**
```cpp
void function1();
void function2();

int main() {
    function1();
    function2();
    return 0;
}
```

Compile the main program and link it with the shared library:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -L. -lmylib -o myprogram
```

---

### Step 5: Run the program
Before running the program, you may need to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to include the directory where your shared library is located.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
./myprogram
```

---

### Output:
```
Function 1 from file1.cpp
Function 2 from file2.cpp
```

---

### Summary of Commands:
1. Compile source files into object files:
   ```bash
   g++ -c -fPIC file1.cpp -o file1.o
   g++ -c -fPIC file2.cpp -o file2.o
   ```

2. Link object files into a shared library:
   ```bash
   g++ -shared file1.o file2.o -o libmylib.so
   ```

3. Compile the main program and link it with the shared library:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -L. -lmylib -o myprogram
   ```

4. Set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and run the program:
   ```bash
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ./myprogram
   ```

---

### Notes:
- **Name Mangling in C++**: If you want to use the shared library in a C program or expose C++ functions to C, you need to use `extern "C"` to prevent name mangling. For example:
  ```cpp
  extern "C" {
      void function1();
      void function2();
  }
  ```

- **Library Naming Convention**: Shared libraries typically follow the naming convention `lib<name>.so`. For example, `libmylib.so`.

- **Dynamic Linking at Runtime**: The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable tells the dynamic linker where to find shared libraries at runtime.

This process will create a shared object file (`libmylib.so`) from multiple C++ source files and allow you to use it in your programs.
